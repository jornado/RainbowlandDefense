# Rainbowland Defense

This mini tower defense game is inspired by the Aug 17, 2019 counter-protest in Portland, OR. Our heroes, the bananas and unicorns, defend Rainbowland from the evil Poop Boys' march!

This was created for [Rainbow Game Jam 2019](https://oslisloth.itch.io/rainbowdefense "link title")

**How to play:**

Select a unicorn or banana with your mouse, then place it on any dark tile. Use WASD keys or the mouse to move around, Q/E or scroll to zoom in and out.
